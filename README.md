# Weather-Dashboard

In this website, I created a weather dashboard with the help of the weather API from https://openweathermap.org/forecast5. To achieve that, I used Jquery, HTML, CSS and DayJS. 

The website has a simple functionality with a search bar where a user can input a city he would like to check, after which he gets the results for the temperature of that city at that particular day, as well as for the following 5 days. The output shows the temperature, wind and humidity, as well as an icon portraying the weather conditions. 

Additionally, with the help of local storage the website then saves the past searches of the user, creating buttons on the screen that they could click to go directly to the city of their interest and get the rest of the information. 

As an add-on, I put the time and date on the nav-bar.
